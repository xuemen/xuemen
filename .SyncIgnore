# .SyncIgnore is a UTF-8 encoded .txt file that helps you specify single files, paths and rules 
# for ignoring during the synchronization job. It supports â€˜?â€™ and â€˜*â€˜ wildcard symbols.
#
# Note that .SyncIgnore is applied only to the folder where it is contained and 
# will not work with the files that have already been synced.
#
# If you add indexed files to .SyncIgnore, they will be deleted on other syncing devices. 
# In order to avoid this:
# 1. Quit BitTorrent Sync or remove the folder from sync on all the devices.
# 2. Modify .SyncIgnore file on all of them so that it contains same info.
# 3. Run BitTorrent Sync or re-add the modified folders.
